# Audio Files for Lofiever

For the application to work properly in development mode, you need to add an audio file:

1. Place a lofi music file named `mock-lofi.mp3` in this directory.
2. You can use any royalty-free lofi music for testing purposes.

Note: In a production environment, the application would stream audio from a server
or external API rather than using static files.
